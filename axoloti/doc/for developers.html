        <h2>Documentation for developers</h2>
        <h3>Abbreviations</h3>
        <ul><li>PEX : parameter exchange. Parameters can be adjusted by the GUI, by MIDI, by recalling presets, and by "scripts". PEX keeps it all in sync.
            <li>AXO : short for Axoloti...
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Object creation search order</h3>
        If the object name starts with "./" or "../"
        <ul>
            <li>the path relative to the current document path will be searched for a ".axo" file
            <li>the path relative to the current document path will be searched for a ".axs" file                
        </ul>
        If the object name does not start with "./" or "../"
        <ul>
            <li>When opening a document, or pasting from the clipboard, the "UUID" 
                hash stored in the document will be matched against objects 
                pre-loaded from the path. The "UUID" of an object is unique
                to the name, and inlets, outlets, parameters, attributes (name+type) of the object.
                The loaded object may have a different name, or changed 
                documentation, but since the functional implementation is the same, 
                it is probably an update of naming or documentation of the object. 
            <li>Objects in the search path by name
            <li>Patches in the search path by name
        </ul>
        <h3>Memory map</h3>
        After startup, SRAM1 is remapped to 0x00000000. This boosts the performance when executing from SRAM1.
        <ul><li>0x20000000-0x20001FFF : vector table
            <li>0x20000200-0x2000BFFF : firmware reserved memory
            <li>0x20011000-0x2001BFFF : patch memory (preferred area for execution)
            <li>0x20011001 : patch init function entry point
            <li>0x10000000-0x1000DFFF : patch memory (CCM RAM, can't execute, can't DMA)
            <li>0x1000F000-0x1000FFFF : firmware reserved memory
            </ul>
        Important: CCM SRAM can't be used for DMA. This does not give errors/warnings, just invalid data!
        <h3>Future work: improving performance</h3>
        <ul><li>For the BLIT oscillators, rearranging the BLIT table to successive polyphase samples, will enable use of the FLASH memory data cache.
            <li>Biquad filter coefficient computation can be improved a lot!
            <li>The biquad filter itself also has room for improvement
            <li>making better use of subtypes: an int32pos outlet connected to an int32pos inlet does not require checking for negative values of the 2nd object.
            <li>eliminating redundant fractional number rightshift+leftshift (needs extra inlet/outlet metadata)                
        </ul>
