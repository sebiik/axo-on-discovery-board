        <H1>Using the STM32f4Discovery board</H1>
        Axoloti is designed to run with the Axoloti Core board. But the STM32f4Discovery can be made to work too. Connect both the mini USB port and the micro USB port to your computer. 
        <H2>Modify the firmware</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>in firmware/axoloti_defines.h, uncomment the line "#define BOARD_STM32F4DISCOVERY 1", and comment the line "#define BOARD_AXOLOTI_V03 1"
            <li>recompile the firmware                
            <li>flash the firmware (using DFU mode)
        </ul>
        <H2>DFU Mode</H2>
        For firmware flashing, DFU-mode for flashing can be enabled - not by pressing S1 as documented for the Axoloti Core - but by connecting the BOOT0 pin to VDD, and the PB2 pin to GND during powerup or reset.
        You can use the jumpers from the backside of the kit for this purpose.
        After flashing, remove the jumpers again from BOOT0 and PB2, and press the reset button.
        <H2>Limitations</H2>
        <ul>            
            <li>SDcard cannot be used (pin conflict with the audio DAC)
            <li>GPIO pins PA4, PA5, PA6, PA7 and PC0 should not be used - they're not free for user I/O on the Discovery board.
            <li>no audio input available
            <li>the on-board microphone is not supported
            <li>the on-board accelerometer is not supported
            <li>the on-board LEDs are not supported
            <li>48kHz sample rate is a bit off : 47991.07031kHz (0.32 cent lower tuning)
        </ul>
