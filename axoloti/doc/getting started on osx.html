        <h1>Getting started on OSX</h1>
        Assumes you have installed from source or downloaded a precompiled binary.
        <h2>Start Axoloti</h2>
        doubleclick axoloti.command in the axoloti directory
        <h2>Compile firmware</h2>
        menu board -> firmware -> compile
        <h2>Flash the firmware</h2>
        Get the board in DFU-mode by holding button S1 while plugging the USB cable.<p>
        Select menu board -> firmware -> upload firmware with DFU <p>
        Get the board out of DFU mode (unplug it from your computer and then plug it back in).
        <h2>Connect</h2>
        If the connect checkbox turns on, but the software stops responding, check if there's an sdcard left in the board and remove it... It probably contained an incompatible start.bin file.
        <h2>Next</h2>
        You're ready to use Axoloti. Next time, you can just start Axoloti and click connect, no need to compile or flash firmware again.
