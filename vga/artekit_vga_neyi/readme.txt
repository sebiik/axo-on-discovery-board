Hey ladies and gentleman,

For recreating the project you'll need STM32F103T8U6 dev. board and some programmer for flashing it.
Just in case I included my Altium project with the board, plus some photos and screens.
There's also a .hex with the firmware precompiled.
On the code – that's just a project I played with, not the cleanest code you can find out there.
Anyway, contrary to Artekit's basic version it has 100% fixed font and some timings fixed + there's a better demo.

The project's for Keil uVision 5, SPL-based(none of this HAL rubbish xD).
Have fun!
